== Chapter 3: Exploring Ecosystems

=== Introduction

Ecosystems are complex networks of organisms and their environment. This chapter explores different types of ecosystems, their structures, and the interactions within them.

=== Terrestrial Ecosystems

((Terrestrial)) ecosystems are found on land and include forests, grasslands, deserts, and tundras.

==== Forest Ecosystem

Forests are characterized by a high density of trees. They are vital for maintaining biodiversity and regulating the global climate.

* Trees
* Shrubs
* Herbivores
* Carnivores
* Decomposers

=== Aquatic Ecosystems

((Aquatic)) ecosystems are found in water environments and include freshwater and marine ecosystems.

  Zooplankton -> SmallFish
  SmallFish -> LargeFish

==== Marine Ecosystem

((Marine ecosystems)) are the largest of Earth's aquatic ecosystems and are distinguished by their high salt content.

=== Energy Flow in Ecosystems

Energy flows through ecosystems via food chains and food webs, starting with producers and moving up to apex predators.

=== Nutrient Cycling

Nutrients cycle through ecosystems, ensuring that essential elements are reused and recycled.

=== Conclusion

Understanding ecosystems is crucial for environmental conservation and management. By studying the interactions within ecosystems, we can better protect and sustain our natural world.
